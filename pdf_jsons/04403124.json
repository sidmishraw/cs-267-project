    "detecting a shared knowledge structure from XML",

    "preliminary work in the area, and as such the aim was",
    "to discuss how tree mining can be appropriately",
    "applied to the problem and to demonstrate its great",
    "potential in automating the task of knowledge",
    "matching. We have used real world XML schemas",
    "and the application of our U3 algorithm for mining of",
    "unordered embedded subtrees has indeed shown its",
    "capability of detecting the shared document structures",
    "To limit the scope of the work we have made the",
    "assumption that the concepts have already been",
    "matched, and hence our immediate future work is to",
    "find semantically correct matches among concepts",
    "through the utilization of tree mining for efficient",
    "knowledge structure analysis",
