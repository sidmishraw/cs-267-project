    "Abstract",
    "Matching of heterogeneous knowledge sources is of",
    "increasing importance in areas such as scientific",
    "knowledge manage",
    "ment, e-commerce, enterprise",
    "application integration, and many emerging Semantic",
    "Web applications. With the desire of knowledge",
    "sharing and reuse in these fields, it is common that the",
    "knowledge coming from different organizations from",
    "the same domain is to be matched. We propose a",
    "knowledge matching method based on our previously",
    "developed tree mining algorithms for extracting",
    "frequently occurring subtrees from a tree structured",
    "database such as XML. Using the method the common",
    "structure among the different representations can be",
    "automatically extracted. Our focus is on knowledge",
    "matching at the structural level and we use a set of",
    "example XML schema documents from the same",
    "domain to evaluate the method. We discuss some",
    "important issues that arise when applying tree mining",

    "1. Introduction",
    "Knowledge discovery task",
    "in general can be hard",
    "and time consuming, and hence sharing the already",
    "developed knowledge representations is desirable. This",
    "particularly occurs when a num",
    "ber of organizations",
    "coming from the same domain would like to have a",
    "knowledge basis on which they can integrate their",
    "organization specific knowledge. Having a general",
    "knowledge model would save time and costs",
    "associated with having to acquire",
    "general",
    "knowledge",
    "about the domain at h",
    "and. Furthermore, the knowledge",
    "base should be represented in a machine readable way",

    "used as the knowledge basis to be used by new",
    "organizations. It is also analogous to the problem of",
    "building a domain specific ontology from a number of",
    "existing knowledge bases. In real world, it is common",
    "that different organizations use different names for",
    "same concepts but this is a different problem of",
    "concept matching which is out",
    "of the scope of the",
    "current work. Hen",
    "ce, the current assumption is that all",
    "concept names are the same, or",
    "some concept matching",
    "algorithm has already been applied to find the",
    "corresponding mappings",
    "Figure 2. Proposed knowledge matching",
    "approach",
    "Figure 2 illustrates our general approach taken to",
    "the matching of tree structured knowledge and at the",
    "same time describes our experimental setup in this",
    "paper. While only two knowledge structures \\(KSs",
    "displayed in the figure the approach is valid when the",
    "number of available KSs is larger. Suppose that we",
    "have two document stru",
    "ctures used by different",
    "organizations for representing the knowledge from the",
    "same domain. The aim is to",
    "merge them into one",
    "representation which",
    "captures the general knowledge",
    "for that specific domain.  Each KS is most likely to",
    "differ in the way the knowledge is represented and the",
    "amount of concept gran",
    "ularity. However since they are",
    "describing the same domain there will be some",
    "common parts of knowledge. This is where a tree",
    "mining approach will prove useful since sub-structures",
    "from large tree databases can be automatically",
    "extracted",
    "The first step is to set up a tree database \\(T",
    "DB",
    "so that",
    "each KS is represented as an",
    "independent subtree \\(i.e",
    "transaction\\. A tree mining",
    "algorithm can then be",
    "applied to the T",
    "DB",
    "in order to extract the common",
    "knowledge structure \\(shared KS\\among each KS",
    "Since each KS is represented as a transaction",
    "transactional support will be",
    "used and set to equal the",
    "number of KSs present in the T",
    "DB",
    "Now we need to",
    "discuss which specific tree mining algorithm should be",
    "used, or in other words what subtree type should be",
    "extracted",
    "As mentioned in the",
    "previous section, when",
    "comparing the similarity among knowledge structures",
    "the order of sibling nodes is irrelevant, since",
    "exchanging the order of sibling concepts does not",
    "change the general information content.  Hence",
    "unordered as opposed to ordered subtrees will be",
    "mined. One further choice",
    "to make is whether we are",
    "interested in mining induced",
    "or embedded subtrees",
    "The difference occurs in the fact that if embedded",
    "subtrees are mined we are allowing sub-structures to",
    "be considered common even if they occur at different",
    "levels in the KS. In an",
    "embedded subtree the",
    "relationships are not limited to parent-child, and hence",
    "allowing ancestor-descendant relationships enables the",
    "extraction of more sub-structures where the levels of",
    "embeddings are different",
    "It is worth noting here that",
    "the specific knowledge about a concept is not always",
    "stored in a way just described. It is commonly the case",
    "that extra specific information about a concept is",
    "stored in form of additional child nodes of that",
    "concept. However since both i",
    "nduced and embedded",
    "subtrees keep all the paren",
    "t-child information",
    "relationships from the original subtree this difference",
    "does not influence the choice of the subtree type to be",
    "mined.   In regards to th",
    "ese observations our U3 [1",
    "algorithm will be used in order to extract the largest",
    "common unordered embedded subtree from the KSs in",
    "the T",
    "DB",

    "the KS from a particular organization, but it is",

  ],

    "therefore valid for all the organizations. Furthermore",
    "each of the different orga",
    "nizations could have their",
    "own specific part of knowledge which is only valid",
    "from their perspective, and wh",
    "ich can be added to the",
    "shared KS so that every asp",
    "ect for that organization is",
    "covered. Hence, the shared KS can be used as the basis",
    "for structuring the knowledge for that particular",

    "applied to the problem and to demonstrate its great",
    "potential in automating the task of knowledge",
    "matching. We have used real world XML schemas",
    "and the application of our U3 algorithm for mining of",
    "unordered embedded subtrees has indeed shown its",
    "capability of detecting the shared document structures",
    "To limit the scope of the work we have made the",
    "assumption that the concepts have already been",
    "matched, and hence our immediate future work is to",
    "find semantically correct matches among concepts",
