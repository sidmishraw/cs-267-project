    "After building an attack scenario database, we apply it",
    "to security operation center \\(S",
    "OC\\. An SOC is the core of",
    "the whole security infrastructur",
    "e. As a technical system, it",
    "provides assistance in automation to security policy management, security organizational management and security",
    "operation management at the upper level. Meanwhile, as the",
    "most important, SOC operates to the whole technical layer",
    "It collects all informatio",
    "n from both security and",
    "non-security products and carri",
    "es out the unified automatic",
    "risk evaluation to tell if they are complying with the policy",
    "and baseline of security management. It will report to the",
    "designated decision maker and give any necessary respond",
    "By linking the security management and security technology, SOC secures the correct deployment of those security",
    "products according to the requirements of security management",
    "While establishing the SOC, it is necessary to notice",
    "that it is not a simplex technology system but an operating",
    "method. It combines the security policy management, security organizational management, security operation",
    "management and security technology framework. SOC has",
    "changed the abstract security",
    "risk management to be evaluative and controllable in our daily life",
    "",
    "We can describe SOC as a center to manage alert from",
    "various attacks. By applying our attack scenario database",
    "into SOC, the system managers are able to understand and",
    "analyse the steps of various attacks, also the ability to predict the next step attacker",
    "s may execute. Thus, an early",
    "warning can be achieved before intrusion damages our",
    "system",
    "The system architecture of",
    "SOC applying our attack",
    "scenario database is shown as below",
    "",
    "Figure 5.1. SOC with attack scenario database",
    "6. CONCLUSIONS",
    "In this paper we proposed the system architecture to",
    "generate an attack scenario database correctly and completely. Firstly, we can classify and extract attack patterns",
    "from four transition states. Th",
    "en, we correlate attack patterns with pre/post conditions matching, that is, to find all",
    "correlation of attack patterns in",
    "each transition state. Finally",
    "we use an approach called",
    "Attack Scenario Generation with",
    "Casual Relationship \\(ASGCR",
    "to build an attack scenario",
    "database One key concept in our approach is to generate",
    "attack scenarios in two phases",
    "Ancestor-free Phase",
    "and",
    "t-Ancestor Phase",
    "This approach can consider all possible",
    "attack steps to be involved in",
    "to attack scenarios, and improve some disadvantages of LAMBDA [3",
    "",
    "and C",
    "A",
    "M",
    "L",
    "",
    "4",
    "",
    "",
    "In our application, we apply this attack scenario database to",
    "SOC system and develop relational modules. Moreover, the",
    "next goal is to generate attack status graph automatically",
    "which can help system managers to observe the alerts and",
    "manage their relationships visually. Finally, this graph can",
    "be used to predict the next step of attacks",
